# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-classification

This is a learning phase project. The whole project is divided into two sections:

* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Classification (Not covered yet)

## Datasets

Dataset repository:  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing

Reasons for choosing this dataset: Randomly selected

## Prerequisites

- python 3.5
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- xgboost

### Exploratory Data Analysis
__Procedure__
1. Target variable distribution
2. Find category variables
3. Check whether null value present or not
4. Visualise null values
5. Relationship between category variables with target variables numerically
6. Convert category to numerical values
7. Find Correlation among all the features
8. Skewness of the features
9. Find important features 
10. Transform numerical data into range interval and visualise the number of target variable data respect to the ranges
11. addNoise(Just for learning purpose)

### Classification Methods
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machines
3. Random Forest
4. K-Nearest Neighbours
5. Naive Bayes
6. Neural Network (will be uploaded in a different project)

### Accuracy of classification
1. ROC value
